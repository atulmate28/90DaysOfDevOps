## 📌 Tasks

## **1️⃣ User & Group Management**

* Learn about Linux **users, groups, and permissions** (`/etc/passwd`, `/etc/group`).
    
* **Task:**
    
    * Create a user `devops_user` and add them to a group `devops_team`.
        
    * Set a password and grant **sudo** access.
        
    * Restrict SSH login for certain users in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
        
* **1️⃣ Create a User and Add Them to a Group**
    
    * **Create the group** 🧑‍💻:
        
    * ```plaintext
          sudo groupadd devops_team 👩‍💻
        ```
        
    
    This command creates the group `devops_team`. Now, let’s add our user to it.
    
    * **Create the user** 👨‍💻 and add to `devops_team`:
        
    * ```plaintext
          sudo useradd -m -G devops_team devops_user 👤
        ```
        
    
    This command creates the user `devops_user` and adds them to the `devops_team` group!
    
    ---
    
    **2️⃣ Set a Password for the User**
    
    Now, let's set a password for `devops_user` so they can log in. 🔐
    
    * **Set the password** 🔑:
        
    * ```plaintext
        sudo passwd devops_user 🔒
        ```
        
    
    You’ll be prompted to enter a new password. Type the password and confirm it. The user now has access!
    
    ---
    
    **3️⃣ Grant Sudo Access**
    
    Next, we want to make sure `devops_user` can perform admin tasks by granting them **sudo** access. ⚙️
    
    * **Add user to** `sudo` group 🔧:
        
        ```plaintext
        sudo usermod -aG sudo devops_user 👑
        ```
        
    
    This gives `devops_user` the ability to run commands as a superuser!
    
    ---
    
    **4️⃣ Restrict SSH Login for Certain Users**
    
    Finally, let's **restrict SSH login** for certain users in the `/etc/ssh/sshd_config` file. 🚫
    
    * **Open the SSH configuration file** 📂:
        
    * ```plaintext
        sudo nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config ✍️
        ```
        
    * **Deny access for certain users** 🚫:
        
    
    In the config file, add:
    
    ```plaintext
    DenyUsers restricted_user 👎
    ```
    
    You can add multiple users by separating them with spaces:
    
    ```plaintext
    DenyUsers user1 user2 ❌
    ```
    
    * **Save and exit** 🖊️.
        
    * **Restart SSH service** 🔄 to apply changes:
        
    * ```plaintext
          sudo systemctl restart sshd 🔄
        ```
        
    
    Now, users listed in `DenyUsers` won't be able to SSH into the system! 🚪
    
* \=========================================================================
    
* ## **2️⃣ File & Directory Permissions**
    
    * **Task:**
        
        * Create `/devops_workspace` and a file `project_notes.txt`.
            
        * Set permissions:
            
            * **Owner can edit**, **group can read**, **others have no access**.
                
        * Use `ls -l` to verify permissions.
            
    * **1️⃣ Create** `/devops_workspace` and `project_notes.txt`
        
        Let’s start by creating the directory `/devops_workspace` and the file `project_notes.txt` inside it. 🗂️
        
        * **Create the directory** 🏠:
            
        
        ```plaintext
        mkdir /devops_workspace 📂
        ```
        
        * **Create the file** 📝:
            
        
        ```plaintext
        touch /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt 🗒️
        ```
        
        ---
        
        **2️⃣ Set Permissions**
        
        Now, let’s set the correct permissions for the owner, group, and others! 🛠️
        
        * **Set permissions** 🔑:  
            The owner will have permission to **edit** (read and write), the group will have **read** access, and others will have **no access**.
            
        
        ```plaintext
        chmod 740 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt 🔐
        ```
        
        Here’s what the permissions mean:
        
        * `7` (Owner): Read, write, and execute (rwx).
            
        * `4` (Group): Read only (r--).
            
        * `0` (Others): No access (---).
            
        
        ---
        
        **3️⃣ Verify Permissions with** `ls -l`
        
        Finally, let’s verify the permissions with the `ls -l` command to make sure everything is set up correctly. 👀
        
        * **Check the permissions** 🔍:
            
        
        ```plaintext
        ls -l /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt 📄
        ```
        
        The output should look something like this:
        
        ```plaintext
        -rwxr----- 1 owner_group owner_group 0 Feb 9 10:00 /devops_workspace/project_notes.txt
        ```
        
        Here:
        
        * `rwx` means the **owner** can read, write, and execute.
            
        * `r--` means the **group** can read.
            
        * `---` means **others** have no access.
            
        
        \======================================================================
        
    * ## **3️⃣ Log File Analysis with AWK, Grep & Sed**
        
        Logs are crucial in DevOps! You’ll analyze logs using the **Linux\_2k.log** file from **LogHub** ([https://github.com/logpai/loghub/blob/master/Linux/Linux\_2k.log](https://github.com/logpai/loghub/blob/master/Linux/Linux_2k.log))
        
        * **Task:**
            
            * **Download the log file** from the repository.
                
            * **Extract insights using commands:**
                
                * Use `grep` to find all occurrences of the word **"error"**.
                    
                * Use `awk` to extract **timestamps and log levels**.
                    
                * Use `sed` to replace all IP addresses with **\[REDACTED\]** for security.
                    
            * **Bonus:** Find the most frequent log entry using `awk` or `sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10`.
                
        
        ### **1️⃣ Find All Occurrences of the Word "error"** 🔍
        
        To search through logs and find all occurrences of the word "error", you can use **grep**. The `grep` command will help you locate the keyword within log files.
        
        ```plaintext
        grep "error" Linux_2k.log 📝
        ```
        
        This command will show all lines containing the word **"error"**.
        
        ---
        
        ### **2️⃣ Extract Timestamps and Log Levels Using** `awk` ⏰
        
        To extract timestamps and log levels (e.g., `INFO`, `ERROR`), we can use **awk**. Let’s assume that the timestamps are at the beginning of each line, and the log level follows after.
        
        ```plaintext
        awk '{print $1, $2, $3}' Linux_2k.log ⏳🆙
        ```
        
        Here:
        
        * `$1`, `$2`, and `$3` refer to the **timestamp** and **log level** (adjust as needed based on the log format).
            
        * This extracts the first 3 fields from the log file: typically date, time, and log level.
            
        
        ---
        
        ### **3️⃣ Replace All IP Addresses with \[REDACTED\] Using** `sed` 🔒
        
        For security reasons, let's redact all IP addresses in the logs by replacing them with `[REDACTED]`. You can use **sed** for this task:
        
        ```plaintext
        sed 's/[0-9]\{1,3\}(\.[0-9]\{1,3\})\{3\}/[REDACTED]/g' Linux_2k.log 🔴
        ```
        
        This command uses a regular expression to match any IP address pattern and replaces it with **\[REDACTED\]**.
        
        ---
        
        ### **4️⃣ Bonus: Find the Most Frequent Log Entry** 🔄
        
        To find the most frequent log entries, use **awk** or a combination of **sort**, **uniq**, and **head**. Here’s the command to do that:
        
        ```plaintext
        awk '{print $0}' Linux_2k.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10 📊🔝
        ```
        
        Explanation:
        
        * `awk '{print $0}'`: Prints the entire line (the full log entry).
            
        * `sort`: Sorts the log entries.
            
        * `uniq -c`: Counts the frequency of each unique log entry.
            
        * `sort -nr`: Sorts the results in reverse order based on frequency.
